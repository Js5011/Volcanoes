  <h2>Shield Volcanos</h2>
  <p>Shield Volcanoes slowly ozze lava, creating a <br> broad shape with gentle slopes</p>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Shield volcanoes are usually constructed almost <br>entirely of basaltic and/or andesitic lava flows which were<br> very fluid when erupted. They are built by repeated <br>eruptions that occurred intermittently over vast periods <br>of time (up to a million years or longer). <br>Shield volcanoes are much wider than they are tall.

    Famous examples of <br>Shield Volcanoes is <i><b>Kiluea</b></i>, and<br> <i><b>Mauna Loa.</b></i>Those two volcanoes<br> are located on a island in the American state of <br>Hawaii, along with other shield volcanoes.<br><br><img src="ShieldVolcanoes.jpg" alt="ShieldVolcanoes"
